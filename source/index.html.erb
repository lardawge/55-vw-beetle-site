        This was the car as I bought it. You can see that it had peanuts and large tailights that would have been added for safety at some point.
        It also came with accessory "Bumpers with overrider" (noted on the birth certificate). I chose to remove those given they were optional and interfere with the brake lights (lights end up in the center of the overrider).
      </p>

      <p>
        The holes for the large tailights and peanut turnsignals as well as any rust on the mounting flanges have been repaired.
        The only body parts that are included and not correct for the car are the left rear fender and the hood. The good news is that both
        of these parts are reproduced or in the works by Dirk Hortig in Germany. His rear fenders are amazing.

        As you can see, all the hard to find parts are included with the car. I have completed restoration on a handful of parts including the original hardware and vent wings.

        I am selling my 1/7/55 American Deluxe Beetle Sedan.
        It was originally a L275 Light Beige car. It was sold through Hollywood California (Competition Motors) and spend its life in SoCal.
        It was found in Valencia California where it was stored in a garage for many years.
        I acquired this car in Oct 2020. I made the choice, based on the condition of the paint as well as overall condition,
        to go down the road of a full restoration.
        As happens, I found another car that has my attention, therefore I am heading in a different direction which is leading me to put this car on the market.
        If you have restored cars, you know that I am taking a huge monetary hit. It is more important to me that this car gets to the right home vs trying to get top dollar.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let me start by saying this is one of the cleanest, rust-free cars I have seen. That was what attracted me to it. It still needed some work. The rear apron was cut out for later exhaust and there was some damage where the rear took a hit (no creases).
        The right front had some damage from a side impact at the left front fender. The left front fender was replaced with a converted bullet fender. The bullet fender had factory primer under the light beige paint so was likley repaired early in its life.
        The dash had been cut for a dealer-installed Motometer gauge cluster, so the dash needed repair. There were also the typical dime-sized rust holes under the right front and right rear fenders where dirt/water collects.
        This needed to be repaired and I wanted to have it done right. I slotted in at Washburn’s Metal in Orange, CA and waited until there was space to take the car in. In the meantime, I dismantled the car and removed the body from the pan.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had Washburn’s Metal restore the pan. The pan halves were in good condition other than dents all over where someone had used a floor jack throughout its life.
        I opted to have the pan halves replaced vs repaired given the early pan halves are available through Gerson and it would have cost much more to correct the damage inflicted by the jack.
        No repairs were needed to the internals of the pan as everything had been nicely preserved from a leaking transmission nose cone. Even the choke cable came out effortlessly.
      </p>

      <p>
        I dropped the numbers matching front end off to George @ The Butcher Shop and had him restore it.
        He powdercoated the beam, trailing arms, knuckles, backing plates, and drums.
        We had all the orginal hardware zinc-plated before assembling the beam with new bushings, german king, and link pins.
        He did a fantastic job and looks better than factory.
      </p>

      <p>
        I acquired a later model split case transmission (1957) that was rebuilt by Wright Gearbox.
        I then assembled the pan with all new brake lines, hoses and german master and wheel cylinders.
        All brake hardware has been refurbished and replated. I then finished it off with powdercoated drums and new shoes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The car itself was dropped off at Washburn’s Metal and media blasted by Americoat. We then had it epoxy primed with SPI at a local body shop in Orange, CA to protect it from the elements.
        Brian and the team proceeded with repairs to the dash, rear apron, as well as a handful of small repairs including patching the small rust areas under the fenders.
        I ended up pulling the car once I decided to part with it. Brian has agreed to finish the last of the metalwork at the new owner's expense.
      </p>

      <p>
        The remaining metal work includes replacing the driver's side rear heater channel (behind the b-pillar, patch panels from Virtanen, Wolfparts are included), small dent repairs on the fenders, and massage the inner apron on the driver's side.
        I am including a good hood but it is off a later car so has a hump that should not be there. It will need to be modified to make it a 4-tab or find the correct hood.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project is in a really good place and needs someone to take over and move it forward.
        You can decide what you want to do with it. Install a ragtop, keep it original, put a big motor in it, or slam it on earlys.
        Up to you. It’s a blank canvas with a really great starting point.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I stated earlier, this car has a slot to get in at Washburn's Metal to sort out the rest of the metal work (the cost involved is the responsibility of the new owner).
        This will allow you to take it to whatever level you want. If you have been involved in VW restoration, you know how hard it is to get a pre 55 beetle that isn't a mess.
        The price I am asking is far less than I have into it but priced to give value to the new owner. My goal is to find a home for this car with someone who appriciates it.
        I will help get things to shipping for sales outside of the SoCal area. I am also open to deliver within a reasonable distance for an additional fee to cover fuel.
